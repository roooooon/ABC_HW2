# ABC_HW2
Implement a generic array of Various numbers (
Complex (real and imaginary parts - a pair of real numbers)
Fractions (numerator, denominator is a pair of integers)
Polar coordinates (angle [radian] - real; coordinates of the end point on the plane))
Implement for them the function of converting each value to a real number equivalent to the written one.
For example, for a complex number, the function is implemented by the formula: sqrt (d ^ 2 + i ^ 2)), and for polar coordinates, the distance.
Order the elements of the array in descending order using the Binary Insertion sort.
The results of a function common to all alternatives are used as keys for sorting and other actions.



Filled container:
Container contains 5 elements.
0: It is complex number: the real = 2, the imaginary = 1. complex calculation = 2.23607
1: It is Fraction: numerator = 3, denominator = 9. the fraction = 0.333333
2: It is complex number: the real = 15, the imaginary = 12. complex calculation = 19.2094
3: It is complex number: the real = 14, the imaginary = 7. complex calculation = 15.6525
4: It is Fraction: numerator = 7, denominator = 13. the fraction = 0.538462
